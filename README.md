Using machine learning to predict Horse races

This was a project I attempted over the summer of 2016.
I used it as a way to better familiarize myself with python, webscraping, and machine learning.

I created many functions to scrape Horse racing site and lookup each horse, jockey, and trainers stats.

After that I took those stats and used Stochastic gradient descent to see if a horses stats were good enough
to predict if a horse would place top three in it's next race.
